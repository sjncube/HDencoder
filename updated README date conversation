# Devskiller programming task - Date Conversion

## Question

A hard-drive factory encodes the shift of manufacture of the hard-drive in 6 characters.

1. The first character is the work shift, A,B or C, that produced the item. Here are the shift work hours.
    
    Shift A works between the hours of 07:00 to 15:00 (exclusive).
    
    Shift B works between the hours of 15:00 to 23:00 (exclusive).
    
    Shift C works between the hours of 23:00 to 07:00 (exclusive).

2. The following two characters are the day of the month the shift is starting.
    A single digit day of the month, such as the 1st, is encoded with two digits -> '01'.

3. The following 2 characters encode the shift month. Months are then encoded with a single character:
    ```
        January     - A
        February    - B
        March       - C
        April       - D
        May         - E 
        June        - F
        July        - G
        August      - H
        September   - J
        October     - K
        November    - L
        December    - M
    ```
    *NB The letter 'I' is skipped*

4. Finally, the last 2 caracters encode the shift year using the last 2 digits of the year.
e.g. 2019 -> 19

Your task is to complete the function *convert_date* so as to convert an input timestamp to the encoding that will be placed on the hard-drive.

For example:
```
convert_date(timestamp_string='2019-07-15 22:03:16')
->'B15G19'
```
```
convert_date(timestamp_string='2015-01-05 07:00:01')
->'A05A15'
```
